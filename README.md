# About Me
## My Interests
  I spend a lot of my weekends outside fishing as it is one of my favorite passtimes. I also enjoy collecting Pokemon cards and sealed product, as well as playing games with my friends.
## Websites I Recommend
  - [Twitch] (https://www.twitch.tv) - I find myself using Twitch every day to keep up with professional League of Legends or watch entertaining content creators.
  - [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com) - Youtube is an extremely useful website that can be used for researching, entertainment and even music. Youtube has so much content, that it would be next to impossible not to find what your looking for.
